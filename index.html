        <p>Iâ€™m <strong>Hyungrae Kim</strong> and my English name is <strong>Andrew</strong>. (I made a English name because some foreigners was not able to call my Korean name exactly)<br>
        <p>I had finished at <a href="https://eng.skuniv.ac.kr/"target="_blank"><strong>Seokyeong University</strong></a> in Seoul about 5 years ago. And I had studied the Textile design which means to make some pattern and design for fabrics, clothes, wall-paper and furnitures else.</p>

        <p>But I just wanted to be a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_designer"target="_blank">Graphic Designer</a> unrelated my major. So, I studied and learned to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Systems"target="_blank">Adobe</a> tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop"target="_blank">Photoshop</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator">Illustrator</a> for graphic design.
        I was able to start working at a graphic design company as soon as finished at University. I used to work making some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand#Brand_identity"target="_blank">BI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_identity"target="_blank">CI</a> and Branding Design else. And I tried to learn more the Adobe programs in the company. Although I liked do design, I was not able to be satisfied about my low salary and welfare that time.
        Finally, I quit and decided to work at trading company of clothing (Some people say it is the clothing vandor), to earn high salary. I was able to earn high salary more than design field but I was not happy for about 3 years. I thought that I had to do somthing for my future life.</p>

        <p>I just would like to make something crative from now on. I mean that I am trying to work things realted Graphic design. More specifically, I would like to work regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design"target="_blank">UI</a>(User Interface), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design"target="_blank">UX</a> (User Experience) and BX (Brand Experience) design. I will show you that the Age is just a number. Even though I am 32 years now, I think that I am not really late to work at design field. I can make creative things better than anyone else.</p>

        <p>If I have a chance to work at your company, I will show you that age is just a number.</p>
